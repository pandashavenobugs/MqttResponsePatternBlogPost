[Mqtt](https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-1-introducing-mqtt/#:~:text=MQTT%20is%20a%20Client%20Server%20publish/subscribe%20messaging%20transport%20protocol.) is a client server publish/subscribe messaging transport protocol and so popular in IoT projects. In this blog post I am going to get into [MQTT response pattern](https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt5-essentials-part9-request-response-pattern/) not the basic.

### Warning: It is required that mqtt version is 5 to use mqtt response pattern

## Why Do We Need MQTT Response Pattern ?

MQTT is usually used for getting data from devices. Sometimes we may need to send data to devices, services, or people. Publishing the message(payload as Buffer) is enough to send subscribers data but there are some issues. For instance, we have a device that has a 3.3V relay and this device subscribes to the "device_1/relay_1".When the message ("1" or "0") is published to the "device_1/relay_1" topic the state of the relay changes depending on the message.

So far so good but there are some issues with it. Is data received by the subscriber? what is the latest situation of the subscriber? The publisher is not sure if the subscriber receives the message. The publisher needs the response coming from the subscriber to be sure, however, only can make certain that the message is delivered to the broker by changing the level of the [QoS](https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-6-mqtt-quality-of-service-levels/).At this point the MQTT response pattern becomes necessary.
